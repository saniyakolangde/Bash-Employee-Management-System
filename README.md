# Bash Employee Management System

This was my project for Introduction to Computer Systems subject which used Bash to creat a shell script which performed as an employee management system. The program was made to carry out the following functions:
1. Add a new employee
2. Remove existing employee
3. List Part time employees
4. List full time employees
5. List all employees with total salary
6. Increase comission for an employee
7. Increase hourly wage or base salary of an employee by a percentage.
